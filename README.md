# Two Examples of Convex-Programming-Based High-Dimensional Econometric Estimators

This repository host code for methods mentioned in the paper *Two Examples of Convex-Programming-Based High-Dimensional Econometric Estimators* by Zhan Gao and Zhentao Shi and replication of the simulation results.

One can easily use the `gao-shi-rmosek.R` file to replicate the simulation studies.
