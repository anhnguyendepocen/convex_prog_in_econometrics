* Zhan Gao and Zhentao Shi: [*Implementing Convex Optimization in R: Two Econometric Examples*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10423).

After local installation of the convex solver [`Mosek`](https://docs.mosek.com/9.1/install/index.html) and the R package `rmosek`, one can  run the R script `gao-shi-rmosek.R` to replicate the simulation studies.
